Running the code:
- the only thing you need to do manually is connect google.colab to import the Project1-Classification.csv
- you can also delete that code portion and import the file in some other method you choose to do 
- everything else can easily be compiled and ran (including the Word embedding portion where the needed files are in !wget)
